        <h3>👨‍💻 Professional Background</h3>
        <p>
          I'm Harish Krishnan, a software engineer based in Stockholm with
          experience in both startups and enterprise environments. I’ve built
          software applications using various technologies, and I actively share
          my knowledge through Udemy courses and technical writing. Previously,
          I have worked with companies like SAP, Boeing, Siemens, and also as a
          contractor at companies like FoodDocs in Tallinn.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Currently, I’m focused on deepening my expertise in Generative AI,
          Machine Learning, distributed systems, and strengthening my
          fundamentals in software engineering. I’m also actively learning Go
          and Rust to build efficient, scalable systems. I’m passionate about
          continuous learning, with a strong interest in applying emerging
          technologies to solve real-world problems.
